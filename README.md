# **Chess GPT**

A web app built with Flask that helps you analyze your chess games and provides insights on mistakes and ways to improve. This app fetches data from the Chess.com API based on the Chess.com username provided by the user. It then retrieves the last game played and passes it to the Chat GPT API for analysis.
